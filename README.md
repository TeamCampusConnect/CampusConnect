# Campus Connect

## Problem Statement

Universities often lack a streamlined way to manage and communicate essential information about campus placements, visiting companies, and student interactions. This gap results in scattered information and ineffective communication between students and the university, leading to a lack of awareness and preparation for placement opportunities.

## Solution

Campus Connect aims to bridge the communication gap by offering a centralized platform where universities can manage placement-related information, and students can easily access, inquire, and engage with placement updates. With distinct roles and access levels, the platform facilitates a transparent, interactive space for both students and the university administration.

## Project Explanation

Campus Connect provides the following key features:

1. **University & Student Registration**: Universities and students register to access a university-specific interface.
2. **Company & Placement Management**: Universities can upload a list of companies visiting for placements, along with placed student data.
3. **Post & Inquiry System**: Students can post questions, share placement experiences, and engage in discussions about companies and placements.
4. **Admin Controls**: University admins have control over posts, allowing them to approve, edit, or delete content, ensuring a safe and relevant community.
5. **User Roles & Permissions**: Distinct roles for admins, students, and companies provide secure and efficient access to relevant data.
6. **Real-Time Notifications**: Important updates are instantly accessible to users, enhancing real-time communication.
